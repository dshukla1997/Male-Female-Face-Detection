# Male-Female-Face-Detection
Objective: Developing a face detection system from scratch that can differentiate between male and female faces.
Approach: Face detection and processing using OpenCV Haar Cascade Classifier to crop and extract face for easiar recognition.
Extracted face is then fed to a supervised learning based classifier Support Vector Machine(SVM) which classifies it into male and female classes.
Tools/Technologies: Python, OpenCV(cv2),Jupyter Notebook
